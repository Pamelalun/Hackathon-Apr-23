# Future Development, Iteration and Implementation

# Technologies Used
## Languages Used
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) Used for the content and structure of the site.
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#CSS_3) Used for the styling of the site.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Used for the back end programming of the site.

## Frameworks Used
* [DJANGO - v3.2 ](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/releases/3.2/) Django is a free and open-source, Python-based web  framework that follows the model–template–views architectural pattern.

* [Bootstrap4 - v4.6](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) was used as the frontend framework.

## Programmes and Applications

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) used for version control and saving work in the repository, using the GitPod extension in Google Chrome to commit to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the project's git repository
* [GitBash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) Terminal used to push changes to the GitHub repository.

* [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) used to create the site's favicon
* [Chrome DevTools](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) - used for debugging, validation (Lighthouse) and taking fullscreen screenshots of the site
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)  - Used to create wireframes.
* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/) Used for hosting and deployment of the live site. Throughout, we have ensured the version being deployed to Heroku matches the development version by checking features and screen layouts on both versions.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  - Used to create and edit the website.
* [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)  - Used to test responsiveness and debug.
